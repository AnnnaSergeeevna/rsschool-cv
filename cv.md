##### Â¡Hola amigos!

For the last six months me and my hubby live in sunny Spain.

Everything, that was in a past life (graduated economic education & own business) is hardly useful now. 

I turn over a new leaf and really inspired by gaining IT knowledge.
I am surrounded by people, who are in love with the software development, so what else could I choose for?
At this moment i have some  skills in using IDE, GIT, knowelege in HTML, CSS,  JS (it's too hard fo me now) and my favorite React!
I'm creating something like a social network 
and it makes me delighted to understand how familiar things work!

My soft skills are also in progress: I plan to upp my English from B1 to B2 and higher.My English is still terrible, but I speak much better than Sergey Lavrov.

I also research the structure and distribution of roles within IT-projects.
